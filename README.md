**Welcome to the R Shiny Workshop**

Thanks for joining us using the Shiny package in R 

We are so happy you are tuning in to learn about coding and some of the possibilities that you can apply to your work, school, or daily life. The "nRc coding group" was initiated at NRC Halifax as a cooperative way to bring together coders and those wanting to learn to code. We expanded to the NRC Women in Science and Innovation group by hosting a series of classes, and now, we are very happy to be part of one of the sessions at the Women in STEM Symposium. 


**Getting Started in R & R Studio**

To download the script, click the green "Code" button and download the files as zip files. Please use a browser other than Internet Explorer (i.e. Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.).
Unzip the files from your "Downloads" section on your computer, then move the files to the folder you will be using as your working directory. 


**R Studio is broken up into 4 different sections**
1) Top left (Source): Where you write and edit scripts
2) Top right (Environment & History): Where you see objects and variables
3) Bottom left (Console): Where you see the results of running a script
4) Bottom right (Files, Plots, Packages, Help): Where you see files in the working directory, resulting plots,and packages to load

These sections are adjustable by hovering cursor on the boundaries of each section and dragging to adjust

**Start a new project**
- In the top right corner, click on the cube with an "R" inside of it
- Select "New Project"
- Select "New Directory"
- Select "New Project"
- Select "Browse" and choose an appropriate folder or make a new folder
- Select "Create Project"

By creating a "project" and working within a "project", it automatically sets the working directory -- so any spreadsheets that you work with can simply be moved to the folder containing the "project" file. Move the provided unzipped files from your downloads into this folder.

**Start a new R script**
- In the top left corner, select the white paper with a green + sign
- Select "R Script"
- To open or import a script, select the yellow folder with the green arrow (top left corner) and select the script you want to open
- To save a script, click the save button --> save your scripts often!
- To run a script, highlight the section of the script you want to run, then click "Run" in the right of the script section
- When writing your scripts, if something is incorrect or incomplete, a little white "x" will be listed beside the lines of code in the script with an error.

**Script in R is case sensitive**
- If a label or variable in an excel sheet you import has capital letters, you need to include capital letters when referring to that label or variable.
- Almost all functions in R are lower case

**Other topics**
- "Code tools" button --> comment/uncomment lines of code
- Environment tab --> clear environment (broom)
- History tab --> clear history (broom)
- Files tab --> shows all of the files that are in the directory you have selected
- Plots tab --> any time you run code that results in a plot, it will appear here
- Packages --> Install and load packages, or click on a specific package to learn more about what is included in that package

**Shortcuts**
- Ctrl + Enter --> Run the current line of code
- Ctrl + A + Enter --> Run all lines of code
- Ctrl + Shift + C --> Comment or uncomment lines
- Ctrl + Shift + M --> %>% (pipes)
